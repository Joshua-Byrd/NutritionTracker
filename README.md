# About

This repository stores my term project for CS683 - Mobile Application Development with Android at Boston University's Metropolitan College. For this project, I have built an Android application to allow users to track their nutritional intake. A user is able to search a database of food items and add them to their current day, and theapp displays a list of all foods eaten as well as a summary of their nutritional content (calories, macronutrients, and saturated fat and fiber).

# Stack
The app is written in Kotlin using Jetpack Compose for all UI construction. It utilizes and SQLite database on the back end, which is automatically prepopulated with food data when the app is installed.
